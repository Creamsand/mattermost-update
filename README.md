> Simple script for comfortable update of Mattermost


## Install

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobbyquaker/mattermost-update/master/mmupdate.sh
chmod a+x mmupdate.sh
```

In the first few lines of the script you possibly have to change the variable `MM_PATH` (default is `/opt/mattermost).

This script utilizes [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), wget and sudo, so these need to be installed as prerequisite.

## Usage

Get the URL of the latest Mattermost tarball from http://about.mattermost.com/download/ and call mmupdate.sh with this
url as parameter.

Example:
```bash
mmupdate.sh https://releases.mattermost.com/3.10.0/mattermost-3.10.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```


## Todo

* Backup of MySQL Database (until now only Postgres is implemented)
* More testing
* Nicer console output (e.g. colored unicode checkmarks)?
* Fully automated update: another script that checks the Mattermost webpage for updates and calls mmupdate.sh
* Get data folder path from config.json
* Supply MM_PATH as command line argument
